<p>During Ramadan, many offices and schools in Muslim-majority countries shut early.</p>
<p>During the last 10 days of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate the Laylat Al Qadr, the holiest night of the year. It commemorates the night that the Quran, the Muslim Holy Book, 
    was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p>You can express well-wishes for Ramadan by saying “Ramadan Kareem” (“Have a generous Ramadan”) or
     “Ramadan Mubarak” (which can translate as “Happy Ramadan).”</p>
<p>After the last day of Ramadan, on Eid-al-fitr, the greeting changes to “Eid Mubarak”. </p>
